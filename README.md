So, dive in and start creating your own .NET applications today!

This guide will walk you through the process of installing .NET on your machine and creating and deploying your first .NET application using Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you will need the following:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Visual Studio Code (download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- .NET SDK (download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))

## Installing .NET

1. Download the .NET SDK from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for your operating system.
2. Run the installation package and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

## Creating Your First .NET Application

1. Open Visual Studio Code, and select `View` > `Terminal`.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new .NET application.
3. Type the following command to create a new console application:
   
   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n MyFirstApp
   ```
   
   This will create a new directory called "MyFirstApp" with a basic .NET console application inside.
   
4. To open the new project in Visual Studio Code, type the following command:
   
   ```bash
   code MyFirstApp
   ```
   
   This will open the "MyFirstApp" directory in Visual Studio Code.

## Running Your Application

1. In Visual Studio Code, select `View` > `Terminal` to open the terminal.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your .NET application is located.
3. Type the following command to run the application:
   
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   
   This will compile and run your application.

## Deploying Your Application

1. In Visual Studio Code, select `View` > `Explorer` to open the file explorer.
2. Navigate to your .NET application directory, and open the `.csproj` file.
3. Select `Debug` > `Start Without Debugging` to build and run your application.
4. Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view your deployed application.

Congratulations, you have now created and deployed your first .NET application using Visual Studio Code!
